# SaaS Book Project

This project shows basic Saas concepts with GitHub Copilot, .NET 9 and Postgresql on an Apple Silicon processor.

Credit goes to Andy Watt - Building Modern Saas Applications with C# and .Net. See the repo below

## Additional Resources
  I have applied some "fixes" relating to the dev container and specfic tools. This is implemented with postgresql and .Net 9.
  For more information and resources, you can visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Modern-SaaS-Applications-with-C-and-.NET/tree/main).

## Dev Container
   On VS code, after building with `docker compose up --build`, ensure postgresql is live by running:
      * docker exec -it postgres /bin/bash
      * psql
      * \l (ensure u find ur db)
  Press F1 and select: Dev Container: "Build and Reopen container"

## Generating Migrations

To generate migrations, you need to use the `dotnet ef` command. Follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to add a new migration:

    ```
    dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
    ```
    3. To apply the migration to the database, run:

        ```
            dotnet ef database update in GoodHabits.Database
        ```
